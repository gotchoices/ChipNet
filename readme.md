## Welcome to ChipNet

### Purpose

ChipNet is a meta-protocol library, written in Typescript, for performing path discovery within a network of nodes in which only peer connections are trusted.  This library was built to affect "lifts" in [MyChips](https://github.com/gotchoices/MyCHIPs), but may be suitable for other peer-to-peer systems.  

This is described as a meta-protocol because this library does not handle communications, state persistence, and other characterics, but rather these are furnished by the library user.

This library provides the following capabilities:

* [Route discovery](doc/discovery.md) - performing a search for a given node identifier, either known to that node's peers, or only it itself
    * Unidirectional search - starting from a single node
    * Bidirectional search - starting from two nodes, or multiple edges of single node

### Development

* Build: npm run build
	* Builds into an ES module
* Test: npm test
* Install Jest VSCode extension for easy test debugging
* Add .editorconfig support to VSCode or other IDE to honor conventions
